# Assignment2 CS530 using C++

## Getting Started
+ First you'll need to pull to repo, do `git clone http_link_in_repo folder_to_save_repo
+ An example of the above would be `git clone https://github.com/username/assignment assignment2`

## Compling The C++ Code
There are many different C++ compilers, to make sure we are all using the same one use this line to complie your code
+ `g++ -std=c++11 file_name.cpp -o output_file

##Branches And Github Tips
+ Everyone should work on their own branch and towards the due date we can merge everything together
+ To create your own branch to work on using the terminal do `git checkout -b branch_name`
+ To see what branch you are working on do `git branch`

## Updating Your Branch
Follow the steps below to update your branch
+ `git add .` (The "." indicates to add everything in the folder to the repo)
+ `git commit -m "message goes here"` (This will add a message of what was changed. Make this a little descriptive so everyone knows what's going on)
+ `git push origin branch_name` (Pushes changes to your branch)
+ `git status` (This command will let you know if your branch is up to date or not)
